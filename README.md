# YouTube Video Stats

Welcome to our beautiful web application that retrieves statistics for any YouTube video you want! With a sleek and intuitive design, you'll be able to fetch the view count, like count, comment count, and even the dislike count for the video using our third-party API. Let's dive in and explore the world of YouTube statistics!

## Getting Started

Using this application is as easy as pie! Just follow these simple steps:

1. Enter the URL of the YouTube video you want to retrieve statistics for into the search bar.
2. Click the "Search" button.
3. Voila! You'll see the video's title, channel, published date, thumbnail, view count, like count, comment count, and even the dislike count.
